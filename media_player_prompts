please generate with background‑removed, an old school 3d graphics neon‑green cyberpunk Linux AI assistant designed in the style of a classic media‑player skin, but shaped like an old‑school retro‑futuristic Thunderbird‑style spacecraft reminiscent of Jetsons‑era 3D design. The body of the craft serves as the interface: a sleek embedded display window on the front hull shows AI responses, system metrics, and task output, similar to a media player’s visualization screen. On the top fuselage, icon‑based controls resemble vintage playback buttons but represent AI modules such as coding tools, research agents, automation pipelines, creative generators, and system orchestration. Along the left side of the ship, a vertical panel of sliders mimics classic equalizer controls, adjusting AI parameters like temperature, reasoning depth, memory toggles, and resource allocation, ending with a small reset button. Circular engine‑pod elements on each side evoke speaker grilles from early Winamp/XMMS skins. A glowing progress bar along the lower hull mirrors a media playback timeline but represents task execution and agent chains. The overall aesthetic blends retro media‑player‑skin nostalgia with Jetsons‑era spacecraft curves and a vivid green terminal‑inspired cyberpunk glow, forming a futuristic yet vintage interface for a feature‑rich Linux desktop AI tool.

please generate with background‑removed, old school 3d inspired by the image below a neon‑green cyberpunk Linux AI assistant designed in the style of a classic media player skin. The interface takes the shape of a stylized robotic head, echoing the playful, character‑themed skins from early Winamp and XMMS. The forehead contains a clean embedded display showing AI responses, system metrics, and task output, similar to a media player’s visualization window. On top of the head, icon‑based controls resemble old‑school playback buttons but represent AI modules: coding tools, research agents, automation pipelines, creative generators, and system orchestration. Along the left side, a vertical slider panel mimics equalizer controls, but instead adjusts AI parameters like temperature, reasoning depth, memory toggles, and resource allocation, ending with a small reset button. Circular processor‑like elements on each side evoke speaker grilles from vintage skins. A progress bar beneath the display mirrors a media playback timeline but represents task execution and agent chains. The overall style blends retro media‑player‑skin aesthetics with a glowing green terminal‑inspired cyberpunk look, creating a nostalgic yet futuristic interface for a feature‑rich Linux desktop AI tool.
